## Hi there 👋 I’m @alromano-q4
```bash
$ npx vip3rousmango
```
I'm Al. I'm a self-taught web developer with a nack for learning new things and breaking stuff. I enjoy being creative but find expressing it artistically, difficult. But, once I found coding, I was able to express that creativity that no paint-brush or paint-mouse ever quite could do for me and I've never looked back since.

:notes: Started with the LAMP-stack, now I'm all about that JAM-stack. :notes:
