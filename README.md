## Hi there 👋 I’m @alromano-q4

```bash
npx vip3rousmango
```

I'm a self-taught "Web Stack" Node Developer with a focus on accessibility first and a knack for web analytics and data visualization dashboards; a firm believer in "user experience first" and HTML First Prototyping approaches when applying best practice standards for web development.

Starting out as a PHP (LAMP) developer (you guessed it, WordPress...) I've recently taken an interest in Information Dashboard design and data visualization using JavaScript as well as becoming more proficient in using Node.js both for DX CLI tooling and for building applications (JAM stack).

:notes: Started with the LAMP-stack, now I'm all about that JAM-stack. :notes:

## A little bit personal
